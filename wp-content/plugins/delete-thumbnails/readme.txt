Find and delete thumbnails & resized images from your Media Library


== Description ==

= Delete thumbnails & resized images from your Media Library =

* Delete some or all of Wordpress's resized images (thumbnails, medium, and large, plus extra ones Plugins/Themes make secretly)
* This can clear thousands of unwanted files from your uploads directory 
* Useful if you've had lots of different theme/plugins over the years, and inadvertently accumulated a vast number of resized images that are no longer used by your site

= Take careful note =

1. Deleting is permanent
1. You can use [this plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) to regenerate your Media Library after (as Wordpress will need the default sizes)

= Please Note =

* 🍺 This is a **recently revived and re-written plugin**, the bad reviews were correct for the old versions, but not current version. If you experience any issues, please open a support request, I'm happy to help fix any issues and help plugin grow.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin from your Plugin browser, or download the plugin and extract the files and upload `delete-thumbnails` to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. View the *Delete Thumbnails* interface under *Tools* in your Wordpress Admin


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What parameters are used to determine if a image is resized? =

After looking at all files in the Wordpress uploads directory, a file is determined as resized when three criteria are meet:

1. It's an image 
1. The file URL is not a main Wordpress Media Library file
1. The filename ends with `-###-###.`

= What is this warning about `chmod` about? =

The method of deletion only works when the server allows PHP to edit the folders contents. CHMOD is the permission settings for files and folders. If you've received a warning of this, the CHMOD on the upload directory is too low.

= It says I have no resized images, but I do =

Please note this is a new plugin (rewritten summer 2017), this plugin was developed and tested in only two server environments - variables on your setup may of not been considered while developing. Please open a request in the Support tab and provide as much info as you're willing to give to help resolve this issue and ensure this plugin works on all setups:

* Wordpress & PHP version
* Location of directory
* Wether or not files are stored in year/month sub folders
* ect.

= How do I backup my files? =

The plugin insists on backups as it removes files permanently, you can ignore and bypass, however you should always [backup your Wordpress installation](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups#Backing_Up_Your_WordPress_Site)
